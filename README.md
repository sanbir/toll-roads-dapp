* You need to upload your project to the [Academy Git](https://git.academy.b9lab.com) exam repository named after you, to which you should have received an email invitation.
* You can make as many commits and pushes as you see fit.
* To assist you with configuring your computer to access the repository, please follow [Gitlab's official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html).

### Project intro

Our project describes a road system that will be represent by 2 overarching smart contracts:

* `Regulator`
* `TollBoothOperator`

These other elements of the system are represented by externally owned accounts:

* owner of `Regulator`
* owner of `TollBoothOperator`
* individual vehicles
* individual toll booths

## Route price

The price will be decided by 3 variables:

* the entry toll booth
* the exit toll booth
* the vehicle type

There variables will be used thus:

* the `TollBoothOperator` defines a base route price from booth A to booth B. The base route price from booth B to booth A maybe non-existent, equal or different.
* the `TollBoothOperator` defines a multiplier for each vehicle type. This is the number by which the base route price is multiplied with to get a specific vehicles route price or deposit.

## External accounts

There are a certain number of off-chain actions, such as proof of identity or secret exchange, that we will address only with a wave of the hand in this project. Smart contracts should make these actions possible via public functions, though.

### Vehicles

We only care about vehicles, not about drivers. It means it can be driven by the vehicle's rightful owner, another driver, or no human driver at all.

* Only vehicles registered with the regulator are allowed to enter the road system.
* Before entering the road system, registered vehicles must make a deposit of at least the amount required by the operator for their vehicle type.
* Upon exit, the exit toll booth will trigger the payment off the deposit and refund the difference to the vehicle.

* This deposit must be accompanied by the address of the toll booth by which they will enter.
* When exiting the road system, the vehicle gives, off-chain, a secret to the exit toll booth.
* The exit toll booth sends this secret to the road operator contract, which is used to unlock the deposit, then pay the road operator the proper fee for the route taken, then refunds the difference to the vehicle.

The off-chain exchange of the secret is handled by a wave of the hand in this project. You are not asked to work on this massive "detail".

### Toll booths

* When faced with a vehicle that wants to enter the road system, a toll booth will confirm, off-chain, the address of the incoming vehicle.
* If the vehicle has made the proper deposit for its type, the booth opens the gate. This part will be simulated in tests.

Here too, you need not work on the off-chain exchange of address of the incoming vehicles.

### Owner of `Regulator`

This account will:

* update the vehicle types in the smart contract.
* ask the smart contract to deploy new `TollBoothOperator`s.
* inform whether an address is a registered `TollBoothOperator`.
* unregister `ToolBoothOperator`s when needed.

### Owner of `TollBoothOperator`

This account will:

* update the base price of routes for all toll booth pairs it sees fit.
* update the multiplier of all vehicle types it sees fit.

In particular:

* if a vehicle just completed a route for which there is no base price, the owner should put a price to it before it can unlock the deposit.
* if a vehicle type has no multiplier, then the road system is closed to this vehicle type.

We will simplify the system by overlooking the fact that the owner may disallow a vehicle type _after_ such a vehicle has entered the system.

## Smart contracts

### `Regulator`

This contract does 2 main things (studiously avoiding the word _functions_ here):

* keep track of the vehicle type for each vehicle address
* deploy new `TollBoothOperator`

This ensures that:

* because the regulator deploys the toll booth operator, road users are confident they are exchanging with a vetted smart contract.
* an address that has no vehicle type is not registered and should not be allowed onto the road system.

Additionally:

* the regulator collects no fees.
* a type of `0` denotes an unregistered vehicle.
* for mnemonics only, you can assign type `1` for motorbikes, `2` for cars and `3` for lorries.

### `TollBoothOperator`

This contract has many functions which have been parcelled out to its inheritance tree, see its interfaces. The things it does:

* can be paused / resumed to pause the vehicle-facing operations.
* keeps track of the regulator.
* keeps track of the base deposit.
* keeps track of the multipliers of vehicle types.
* keeps track of the toll booths under its purview.
* keeps track of the route base prices.
* accepts deposits from vehicles.
* accepts exit calls from toll booths.
* accepts messages to clear the exit backlog.

For simplicity's sake:

* there is only 1 (or 0) toll booth at a given kilometre on the road. So one booth may have as many gates as there are lanes on the road.
* a base route price of `0` denotes an absence of information.
* the entry and exit booths of a route cannot be the same address.
* the `TollBoothOperator` has total control over the deposit, the base route prices, and the multipliers.
* there is no congestion or pollution charges.
* the latest route base price is the valid route base price, even if the road operator changed the price after the vehicle entered the road system.

## Fee mechanics

For a vehicle to be accepted on the road system and the operator to be paid at the end of the route, a little dance is engineered:

* before entering the system, the vehicle deposits the required amount into the `TollBoothOperator`, and passes along the address of the entry booth and a unique hashed secret of its own choice. The vehicle keeps the secret until the end of the trip.
* when faced with the toll booth it mentioned when depositing, it proves its identity off-chain (we talk about this identity proof but you need not implement it), after which the booth opens the gate.
* when exiting the road system at a booth, the vehicle gives the exit toll booth its unhashed secret off-chain. Again, we talk about this off-chain exchange but you do not need to implement it.
* the exit toll booth then submits this secret to the `TollBoothOperator`, which unlocks the deposit for payment and refund of the difference, if applicable.
* if the fee is equal to or higher than the deposit, then the whole deposit is used and no more is asked of the vehicle, now or before any future trip.
* if the fee is smaller than the deposit, then the difference is returned to the vehicle.
* if the fee is not known at the time of exit, the pending payment is recorded, and "base route price required" event is emitted and listened to by the operator's oracle.
* when the oracle receives a new base route price request, it submits the base fee, which also clears one pending payment.
* if there are more than 1 pending payments, an additional function is there to progressively clear the backlog a set number of pending payments at a time in a FIFO (of the exit) manner.

For simplicity's sake, we have not implemented a deadline after which the deposit is returned to the vehicle. Also, the function to clear pending more than 1 payment is an ugly one, because it implies a loop and multiple transfers. We actually use it to see how many pending payments you can cram in a single transaction.

## Contract overview

All interfaces are found in the `contracts/interfaces/` folder and are suffixed with `I`, a capital `i`. Here is the list of them:

* `OwnedI`, which keeps track of the owner of a contract.
* `PausableI`, which keeps track of the _paused_ status of a contract.
* `RegulatorI`, which describes methods required of the regulator.
* `RegulatedI`, which keeps track of who the regulator is.
* `MultiplierHolderI`, which keeps track of the multipliers to attach to vehicle types.
* `DepositHolderI`, which keeps track of the base deposit required of vehicles.
* `TollBoothHolderI`, which keeps track of addresses that represent toll booths in the system.
* `RoutePriceHolderI`, which keeps track of the base route prices between entry and exit toll booths.
* `TollBoothOperatorI`, which describes methods required of the toll booth operator for interaction with vehicles.

The contracts you need to create in their individual files in the `contracts/` folder are as follows. Note that we will use your implementations against our battery of Truffle unit tests. You can see a sample of them in the test folder. So it is important that you stick to the naming and the parameters order.

When we say that `One` inherits from `OneI` and `Two` inherits from both `OneI` and `TwoI`, we leave it to your best judgement as to how to use `One` when coding `Two`. Remember that inheritance is transitive.

### `Owned`

It extends:

* `OwnedI`

and has:

* a modifier named `fromOwner` that rolls back the transaction if the transaction sender is not the owner.
* a constructor that takes no parameter.

### `Pausable`

It extends:

* `OwnedI`
* `PausableI`

and has:

* a modifier named `whenPaused` that rolls back the transaction if the contract is in the `false` paused state.
* a modifier named `whenNotPaused` that rolls back the transaction if the contract is in the `true` paused state
* a constructor that takes one `bool` parameter, the initial paused state.

### `Regulator`

It extends:

* `OwnedI`
* `RegulatorI`

and has:

* a constructor that takes no parameter.

### `Regulated`

It extends:

* `RegulatedI`

and has:

* a constructor that takes one `address` parameter, the initial regulator; it should roll back the transaction if the regulator argument is `0`.

### `MultiplierHolder`

It extends:

* `OwnedI`
* `MultiplierHolderI`

and has:

* a constructor that takes no parameter.

### `DepositHolder`

It extends:

* `OwnedI`
* `DepositHolderI`

and has:

* a constructor that takes one `uint` parameter, the initial deposit wei value; it should roll back the transaction if the deposit argument is `0`.

### `TollBoothHolder`

It extends:

* `OwnedI`
* `TollBoothHolderI`

and has:

* a constructor that takes no parameter.

### `RoutePriceHolder`

It extends:

* `OwnedI`
* `TollBoothHolderI`
* `RoutePriceHolderI`

and has:

* a constructor that takes no parameter.

### `TollBoothOperator`

It extends:

* `OwnedI`
* `PausableI`
* `RegulatedI`
* `MultiplierHolderI`
* `DepositHolderI`
* `TollBoothHolderI`
* `RoutePriceHolderI`
* `TollBoothOperatorI`

and has:

* a constructor that takes in this order:
  * one `bool` parameter, the initial paused state.
  * one `uint` parameter, the initial deposit wei value; it should roll back the transaction if the deposit argument is `0`.
  * one `address` parameter, the initial regulator; it should roll back the transaction if the regulator argument is `0`.
* a fallback function that rejects all incoming calls.

## Migrations

You need to create one migration script `2_...js` that will:

* deploy a regulator,
* then call `createNewOperator` on it.
* then resumes the newly created operator, which should be paused before the resume step.

## Tests

A quick note on wording:

* "a / the deposit" refers to the value that the contract requires from entering vehicles.
* "what is deposited" means what was actually sent by the vehicle upon entering.

You may create as many tests as you want but we still want you to create tests for the following scenarios. 

* Scenario 1:
  * `vehicle1` enters at `booth1` and deposits required amount (say 10).
  * `vehicle1` exits at `booth2`, which route price happens to equal the deposit amount (so 10).
  * `vehicle1` gets no refund.
* Scenario 2:
  * `vehicle1` enters at `booth1` and deposits required amount (say 10).
  * `vehicle1` exits at `booth2`, which route price happens to be more than the deposit amount (say 15).
  * `vehicle1` gets no refund.
* Scenario 3:
  * `vehicle1` enters at `booth1` and deposits required amount (say 10).
  * `vehicle1` exits at `booth2`, which route price happens to be less than the deposit amount (say 6).
  * `vehicle1` gets refunded the difference (so 4).
* Scenario 4:
  * `vehicle1` enters at `booth1` and deposits (say 14) more than the required amount (say 10).
  * `vehicle1` exits at `booth2`, which route price happens to equal the deposit amount (so 10).
  * `vehicle1` gets refunded the difference (so 4).
* Scenario 5:
  * `vehicle1` enters at `booth1` and deposits (say 14) more than the required amount (say 10).
  * `vehicle1` exits at `booth2`, which route price happens to be unknown.
  * the operator's owner updates the route price, which happens to be less than the deposited amount (say 11).
  * `vehicle1` gets refunded the difference (so 3).
* Scenario 6:
  * `vehicle1` enters at `booth1` and deposits more (say 14) than the required amount (say 10).
  * `vehicle1` exits at `booth2`, which route price happens to be unknown.
  * `vehicle2` enters at `booth1` and deposits the exact required amount (so 10).
  * `vehicle2` exits at `booth2`, which route price happens to be unknown.
  * the operator's owner updates the route price, which happens to be less than the required deposit (so 6).
  * `vehicle1` gets refunded the difference (so 8).
  * someone (anyone) calls to clear one pending payment.
  * `vehicle2` gets refunded the difference (so 4).

We will run your tests against our hopefully-correct implementations, for which we expect your tests to pass. We will also run your tests against our purposefully-incorrect implementations, for which we expect your tests to fail.

## GUI

We want you to create a simple UI with 4 pages. You do not need to make it look fancy. But it has to be functional. It is ok if it requires copy / paste of addresses and secrets from the human user.

You can use the framework of your choice, and it is good manner to add some instructions on how to make it run within the VM. If there is any NodeJs package that you would like to use make sure they appear in `package.json` and you committed it too.

So:

* a page for the deployed `Regulator`'s owner, which allows it to:
  * set vehicle types.
  * create a new `TollBoothOperator`.
  * no need to make it possible to change the regulator on the individual `TollBoothOperator`s.
* a page for the `TollBoothOperator`'s owner, which allows it to:
  * add toll booths.
  * add base route prices.
  * set multipliers.
  * no need to make it possible to change owners of the contract.
  * no need to make it possible to pause the contract.
  * no need to make it possible to remove toll booths.
  * no need to make it possible to change the required deposit.
  * no need to make it possible to clear one pending payment.
* a page for individual vehicles, which allows it to:
  * see its basic Ether balance.
  * make an entry deposit.
  * see its history of entry / exit.
  * no need to see its pending payments.
* a page for individual toll booths, which allows it to:
  * report a vehicle exit.
  * be informed on the status of the refund or of the pending payment of the vehicle reported above.
  * no need to see its history of entry / exit.

## You code!

This is not a gotcha exercise where a minute error makes you lose huge points. We want to see you at your best so let us know of any access issues or misunderstanding.
